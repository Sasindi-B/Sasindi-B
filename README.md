👋 Hey there, I'm Sasindi

Computer Science Undergraduate @ SLIIT 🇱🇰
Builder • Innovator • Web3/Software Enthusiast

I’m passionate about creating meaningful digital experiences—
from university projects to personal builds, to real-world products for my own startup, which I’m building together with three amazing friends.

Here, I share my journey across:

🚀 Projects I build in my free time

📚 University coursework & engineering challenges

🛠️ Startup experiments & side-hustle product ideas

🌐 Tech learnings across Web2 + Web3 ecosystems

Always exploring, always building.
Let’s connect & grow together!
